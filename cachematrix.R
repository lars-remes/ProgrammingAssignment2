## Functions for creating and using special matrix object that are able
## cache results of costly operation.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it 
## repeatedly.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
}

## The following function calculates the mean of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the 
## inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.
##
## Example:
## m <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
## cm <- makeCacheMatric(m)
## cacheSolve(cm)
## cacheSolve(cm)

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
